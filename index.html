        <h2>I am Carl Andre A. De Castro, a college student pursuing a 
            Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
             I chose Computer Science because I was inspired 
             to make video games from Pok√©mon.
              One of my strengths is that I can manage my time very well, 
              which helps me with my programming tasks.
              I aspire to become a game developer in the future. 
              In my free time, I enjoy exploring nature and playing Sudoku.
               I believe that technology can make the world more efficient. </h2>
